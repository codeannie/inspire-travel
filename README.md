---

Capstone project at Thinkful while learning about Async Requests.

## Introduction

Not sure where to go next? Use this app to get an idea of a potential destination!

[Live Demo](https://codeannie.github.io/inspire-travel/)

## Description

This capstone utilizes Google Places API to get the destination's longitude and latitude. 
Then using the coordinates, it does the following:

- Calculate the location time from Google Maps Time Zone API
- Look up the weather forecast from AccuWeather API
- Display photos taken within 32km from Flickr API 

*Disclaimer regarding Flickr images: It is a bit of challenge to control the quality and type of photos from Flickr. The best I could do was to turn on Getty Images pool and filter by specific tags to get more "travel"-like photos.*
